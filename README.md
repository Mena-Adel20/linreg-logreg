# linreg-logreg
## Perform analysis on the dataset to:
<ol>
<li>check whether there are missing values</li>
<li>check the type of each feature (categorical or numerical)</li>
<li>check whether numerical features have the same scale</li>
<li>visualize a pairplot between numercial columns</li>
</ol>

## Preprocess the data such that:
<ol>
<li>records containing missing values are removed</li>
<li>the features and targets are separated</li>
<li>the data is shuffled and split into training and testing sets</li>
<li>categorical features and targets are encoded </li>
<li>numerical features are standardized</li>
</ol>

 ### Fit a linear regression model to the data to predict the loan amount, Using sklearn's linear regression.
 ### Evaluate the linear regression model using sklearn's R2 score.
### Fit a logistic regression model to the data to predict the loan status-> Implement logistic regression from scratch using gradient descent.
### Write a function (from scratch) to calculate the accuracy of the model
